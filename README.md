# BMI Calculator

About BMI: 

Body mass index (BMI) is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height expressed in units of kg/m<span style="vertical-align:super; font-size:8px">2</span> resulting from mass in kilograms and height in meters. Although mathematicians have cautioned that it is not an accurate measure and therefore not generally useful in evaluation of health, in the medical community it is considered a satisfactory tool for measuring whether sedentary individuals are underweight, overweight or obese with various exceptions: athletes, children, the elderly, and the infirm.

About the calculator:
Creating and styling the calculator was infinitely less controversial.  A live demo can be found on this [github page](https://arctwain.github.io/BMI-calculator/) and on my website under [BMI Calculator](http://tinaanastos.com/bmi/).
